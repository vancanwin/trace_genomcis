# trace_genomcis
Python version > 3.5
Using Jupyter Notebook to run simulations.

Contains 3 main functions:
1. garden_matrix - generates the number of carrots in a garden randomly for any NxM matrix
2. eat_carrots - finds the left, right, top, bottom cells and identify which carrots will be eaten stores the # 
of carrots and the coordinates.
3. run_rabbit - runs the entire simulation that generates the garden_matrix (N,M) and runs eat_carrots in a loop 
until the surrounding cells are values 0
